This project seeks to create a better 7DTD Gameserver platform that can be configured and managed from the built-in webserver.

**TO BUILD**

Be sure to copy this command carefully!

```
time docker build -t u18/7dtd .
```

**TO RUN** 

First, create a Steam account specifically for your server. Use these credentials below.

```
docker run -dt -v$(pwd)/data:/data \
  -p26900:26900/udp -p26900:26900/tcp -p26902:26902/udp \
  -p80:80 -p8080:8080 -p8081:8081 -p8082:8082 \
  -e STEAMCMD_LOGIN=YOUR_STEAM_USERNAME \
  -e STEAMCMD_PASSWORD='YOUR_STEAM_PASSWORD' \
  -e STEAMCMD_APP_ID=294420 -e INSTALL_DIR="/data/7DTD" \
  -e 7DTD_AUTOREVEAL_MAP=true \
  --name=u18-7dtd u18/7dtd
```

**TO INSTALL STEAM GAME**

This command will initiate a Steam Guard request and require you to type in the code that Steam emails you. When this command completes, your server will begin generating a new world and will start the server. 

```
docker exec -it u18-7dtd /install_7dtd.sh
```

**TO ENTER**

```
docker exec -it u18-7dtd bash
```
